# Feed forward for Ackerman-steered (car-like) vehicles

The path (its x- and y-positions) is time indepedent, but a path tracking control and its feed forward are time depedent.

Here, flatness-based feedforward controls are derived, because for nonlinear systems it is more accurate.

The flat ouput is ![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?O_t%3D%5Ctext%20%7B%20Onset%20event%20at%20time%20bin%20%7D%20t)

# Feed forward for Ackerman-steered (car-like) vehicles

The path (its x- and y-positions) is time indepedent, but a path tracking control and its feed forward are time depedent.

Here, flatness-based feedforward controls are derived, because for nonlinear systems it is more accurate.

The flat ouput is katex.render("c = \\pm\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}", element, {   throwOnError: false});
